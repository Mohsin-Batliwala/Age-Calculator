          Iâ€™m excited to introduce my latest project: an Age Calculator website!
          This user-friendly tool allows visitors to quickly determine their age
          based on their birthdate. With a sleek and intuitive design, the
          website makes it simple to input your birthdate and instantly get your
          age in years, months, and days. Whether you're tracking your age for
          personal milestones or need to calculate age for various applications,
          this website is designed to provide accurate and immediate results. I
          hope you find it both useful and easy to navigate This is a project
          made by Mohsin Batliwala. The project is a website of age calculator .
          This was made by mohsin with help of his friends Hasnain and Abdul
          rehman. Our computer teacher Aasim sir guided us for this â€¼ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
